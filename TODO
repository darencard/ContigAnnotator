1. Add script to perform non-best hit reciprocal analyses for homology.
2. Possibly switch blast steps over to BioPython blast module if it provides spead (unlikely) or functionality.
3. Allow user to enter blast ID/description so that annotation will include the type of blast analysis that indicates the homology (e.g., rbh, one-way, reciprocal hits, etc.).
